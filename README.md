# Lab 5 Part 1

## Teddy Ni - CS52

### What worked
- Routing, setting up the server, understanding the flow and logic
- Hooking up to Mongoose
- Deploying easily to heroku

### What didn't work
- Mongoose queries turn out to be quite complicated, and seem to be limiting in its power to run custom queries
- Adding complicated features take time and quite a bit of effort to set up the full end-to-end integration

### Extra Credit
- Added upvotes and downvotes
- Added a date created field
- Added a sort by feature, where you can sort by different filters

### What worked 
- Authentication turned out to be pretty easy when modulized
- Adding new features with authentication

### What didn't work
- Authentication can also lead to complications
- Mongoose queries are NOT find to write

### Extra Credit
- Restricted voting to authenticated users
- Added error handling messages
- Added live username validation (for example, when signing up, try typing in an already existent username such as 'ted')
- Extended editing permission such that only the creator of a post can edit/delete it
- Added a "ContentType" field to posts
