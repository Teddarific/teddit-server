# Lab 5

## Teddy Ni - CS52

### What worked
- Routing, setting up the server, understanding the flow and logic
- Hooking up to Mongoose
- Deploying easily to heroku

### What didn't work
- Mongoose queries turn out to be quite complicated, and seem to be limiting in its power to run custom queries
- Adding complicated features take time and quite a bit of effort to set up the full end-to-end integration

### Extra Credit
- Added upvotes and downvotes
- Added a date created field
- Added a sort by feature, where you can sort by different filters
